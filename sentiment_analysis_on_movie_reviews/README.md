## Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

### Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset

"There's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy, and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side."

The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, originally collected by Pang and Lee [1]. In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus. This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. You are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive. Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.


Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This competition was inspired by the work of Socher et al [2]. We encourage participants to explore the accompanying (and dare we say, fantastic) website that accompanies the paper:

There you will find have source code, a live demo, and even an online interface to help train the model.

### Data Files

File Name	| Available Formats
          |
test.tsv	.zip (470.84 kb)
sampleSubmission	.csv (582.66 kb)
train.tsv	.zip (1.21 mb)

The dataset is comprised of tab-separated files with phrases from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. The train/test split has been preserved for the purposes of benchmarking, but the sentences have been shuffled from their original order. Each Sentence has been parsed into many phrases by the Stanford parser. Each phrase has a PhraseId. Each sentence has a SentenceId. Phrases that are repeated (such as short/common words) are only included once in the data.

train.tsv contains the phrases and their associated sentiment labels. We have additionally provided a SentenceId so that you can track which phrases belong to a single sentence.

test.tsv contains just phrases. You must assign a sentiment label to each phrase.

The sentiment labels are:

0 - negative
1 - somewhat negative
2 - neutral
3 - somewhat positive
4 - positive
